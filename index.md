Hi! I'm Yifei Huang (黄逸飞), a PhD student in [Sato Laboratory](http://www.hci.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), which is in the [Institute of Industrial Science](https://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) of the [University of Tokyo](http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/). I am now working with [Prof. Yoichi Sato](http://www.hci.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~ysato/index.html) under the [JST CREST](http://www.hci.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~cvs/) project, which focuses on understanding and assistance of group activities using first-person vision.
